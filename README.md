This project is a **progressive Web Messaging Application** built as part of a learning journey through **J2EE technologies** and modern Java EE practices.

---

## 📚 Project Concept

The goal is to develop a **Web Application** using **JSP** and **Servlets** where:

- Visitors (not authenticated) can see **public messages** on the **Home Page**.
- Registered users (after authentication) can **view their personal messages**.

## 🧠 Learning Progression

| Step | Technologies | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1️⃣ | J2EE (Servlet + JSP) | Basic web app with authentication and messaging |
| 2️⃣ | Hibernate ORM | Add object-relational mapping with Hibernate |
| 3️⃣ | JPA Standard | Transition to JPA to showcase standardization |
| 4️⃣ | Spring Data JPA  | future integration for even higher abstraction |

✅ Each evolution is done **step by step** with clear commits to compare versions.
